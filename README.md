# rxr-01_ros

## Configuring Raspbery-PI 3B+ onborad of the Turtlebot3:

1) Download an image from [Ubiquity Robotics](https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html)
   
   *Use instructions on how to deploy it onto Raspberry (trick: to have internet connection while using ssh to set all stuff, plug Ethernet cable into Raspberry)*
   
- On the first launch use `sudo raspi-config` to turn camera support on and resize OS to the whole memory card. Then **reboot**.

2) Use instructions onto deployment of [Turtlebot3 packages](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/raspberry_pi_3_setup/#raspberry-pi-3-setup).

**NB: Avoid `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/robotis_tools/master/install_ros_kinetic_rp3.sh && chmod 755 ./install_ros_kinetic_rp3.sh && bash ./install_ros_kinetic_rp3.sh ` â€“ this will introduce disorder into preconfigured by Ubiquity packages!**

Avoid *"size optimization"* step with packages deleting. In general those packages are used on a PC part in PC+Tb3 setting, but we tun but for current stage we'd decided to leave all code as it is. 
`sudo rm -r turtlebot3_description/ turtlebot3_teleop/ turtlebot3_navigation/ turtlebot3_slam/ turtlebot3_example/`
 

## Steps for onboard camera installation
### udev 
- to get info on your vebcams:
`lsusb -v` -- you need some properties to identify them further in udev rules.
udev rules needed to grant access to camera resources:

at dir : `/etc/udev/rules.d` create file like ours: `99-uvc.rules`
change file to add access to your cameras like this, aim is to change access-mode:
```
# UVC cameras
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ATTRS{idVendor}=="046d", MODE="0666"
# ^ Change the vendor and product IDs to match your camera.
```


### parameters 
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-libuvc-ros ros-kinetic-libuvc-camera
```

NB: when running example like  `roslaunch libuvc_camera test.launch` or configuring rxr1 package for your turtlebot setting, go to usb cameras launchfile itself and set appropriate camera devices via specifying **vendor**, **product** and **serial** parameters.
*if you have several identical cameras (with identical "serial" values) , set <param name="index" value="0"/> and  <param name="index" value="1"/> for first and second cameras*. 



## packages for speech-control
# TODO


# dependancies install: script
```
roscd rxr1_demo_upstart
cd ../..
rosdep install --from-path src
catkin_make
```


## upstart configure 
After you've tuned the usb_cameras.launch with appropriate parameters general upstart initialisation can be performed.

example: 
*as the launch procedure directly depends on launch timeout which shold be tuned, more convinient logging directory wold be nice to have*
```
mkdir /home/ubuntu/logs/ && mkdir /home/ubuntu/logs/rxr1_bringup
chmod +rw /home/ubuntu/logs/rxr1_bringup
rosrun robot_upstart install rxr1_demo_upstart/launch/rxr1_demo_upstart.launch --logdir /home/ubuntu/logs/rxr1_bringup --user ubuntu
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl start rxr1
```
